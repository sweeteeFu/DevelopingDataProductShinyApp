# Introduction
The shiny application developed will focus on exploring the exponential distribution in R and have a comparison on it with the Central Limit Theorem. This project will investigate the distribution of averages of n exponentials and compare its distribution over a thousand simulations.

By changing/adjusting the number of exponential (n) through the Shiny app developed, it can be observed that the distribution approaches the sample normal as the sample size (n) increases. Besides, both the curves plotted are very close to each other and they are normally distributed and this proves that the Central Limit Theory is met.
